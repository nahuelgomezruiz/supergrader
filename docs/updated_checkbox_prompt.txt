SYSTEM:
You are an expert code grader. Think step‑by‑step **silently**; show only the final JSON.

USER:
Entire rubric for this section (for context only):
1. Abstraction (3.0 pts) [RADIO]
   Q: **Abstraction barriers are well-maintained between classes.** 
- Primary data structure (e.g., hash table, tries, etc.) and command loop are not in the same class
- Every class has a specific purpose in the implementation, and there is little overlap in the functionality of classes
   W: **Abstraction is attempted, though some modules or classes may violate abstraction barriers.**
- Data structures may be specific to `gerp`, but implementing this decision does not break abstraction.

Ex: The submission may have public functions related to files or line numbers, but underlying structs are still private
   E: No credit.
2. Modularity (3.0 pts) [RADIO]
   Q: **Code exhibits great modularity.** 
- Helper functions are used when necessary
- Every function has a specific, singular purpose.
   W: **Small amounts of code might be unnecessarily repeated,** but this does not make the code harder to follow:

- Some functions may be longer in length, but in general reasonable helper functions are present.
   E: **Large sections of code are repeated** or some code is repeated many times, but the code is still readable:
- Some functions might do many things, and it would be appropriate to break them up
- **OR** helper functions are not always called where they might be helpful
   R: No credit.
   T: File I/O is handled concisely and elegantly.
   Y: The submission uses `std::map` or `std::unordered_map`.
   U: The submission **does not** build an index.
   I: The submission would only work for specific datasets.
   O: The underlying data structure and command loop are in the same class.
   P: Structs should be private to hide the internal details from the client.
   A: Please see inline comments.

YOUR SPECIFIC TASK - Evaluate this single checkbox:
Rubric item (CHECKBOX, {{points}} pts):
«{{rubric_description}}»

Student submission (trimmed):
{{file_name_1}}
```{{language}}
{{file_content_1}}
```
{{file_name_2}}
```{{language}}
{{file_content_2}}
```

INSTRUCTIONS:
The above rubric section is provided for context only. Your task is to evaluate ONLY the specific checkbox item shown above.

TASKS – for this single checkbox only:
1. Decide **check** or **uncheck**.
2. Gather the most relevant evidence lines for your decision (file + line range).
3. Draft a short feedback comment explaining your decision (for both check and uncheck).
4. Estimate a confidence percentage (0‑100).

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no extra text):
```json
{
  "decision": "check" | "uncheck",
  "evidence": { "file": "…", "lines": "start‑end" },
  "comment": "…",
  "confidence": 0‑100
}
```

Remember: think internally first, then output **only** the JSON block.
